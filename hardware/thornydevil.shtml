    <p>It's annoying to play games on my phone using the on-screen controls. Thumbs get in the way of seeing the screen! I had a bunch of buttons and a microcontroller left over from keyboards and I thought "I make my own keyboards, why not my own game controller"?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The thorny devil started life as a qmk keyboard, but quickly became apparent that for such a simple bit of kit, directly programming the microcontroller was the way to go. The four pins on each side hypothetically allow for joysticks to be added, but I haven't had the need or inclination to implement that yet.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>After soldering the board and testing it out for the first time, I quickly decided on the name. Before clipping the pins on the underside, it was really quite uncomfortable to use!</p>
