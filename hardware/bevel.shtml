    <p>The first keyboard I designed from the ground up, and an important stepping stone towards my current daily drivers. Currently on the second revision, the first try had a few issues - nothing that couldn't be worked around, but just annoying enough that I wanted to fix them. I use a slightly-modified footprint for the pro-micro, so the circuit board is flippable for each half but the microcontroller is face-up on both halves.</p>
    <p>Designing the bevel was a lot of fun, since it meant an opportunity to learn pcb design, which was much less scary than expected.</p>

    <p class="gallery-description">turns out only a few pins on the pro micro support the data line for splitting the halves, so that had to be jumped to a different pin</p>

    <p>All things considered I think it went well. You can find a copy of the keymap in my <a href="https://github.com/Gnawman/qmk_firmware/tree/gnawman/keyboards/bevel">QMK fork</a>.</p>
