    <p>My daily driver for home life. Perfect number of keys, plus a rotary encoder to control volume and play-pause. Originally the buttons were mapped to screenshot and open programs, but I've found it's more useful to have them as F13, F14, and F15 so I can use them for custom functions in software which allows for control mapping.</p>
