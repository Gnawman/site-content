    <h3 id="1-2-environment-and-biosphere">1.2 Environment and Biosphere</h3>
    <p>Prior to imperial settlement, the dominant biophere was grassland and light forest, temperate at the equator and significantly below freezing at the polar caps. No evidence of prior xenos-breed occupation has been found. Calor's main geological feature of note are unusual geological formations, slender stone-like "horns" curving to pointed tips; most often found in pairs, see Appendix 5.1 for more details. Likely due to the wide range of grazing lands, the most common families of indiginous fauna are ruminant in nature. Most are psudeo-porcine in appearance, leading to their unofficial designation as "pigs", often with a specificatory prefix eg. "snoutpigs", "fangpigs", "milkpigs", "bloatpigs", etc.</p>
    <p>Currently, the majority of Calor has been developed. Approximately 73% of the planet's surface is dedicated to climate-controlled document storage, locally referred to as the "Stacks". Calor's main industries are processing, maintenance, cataloguing, and recovery of documents. Secondary industries include vellum and food production. While settlement and development resulted in the extinction of most species on Calor, some rapidly adapted to the new environment. Mainly omnivorous porcine, these species inhabit sectors of the Stacks which have fallen into disrepair - fully capable of subsisting on parchment, most prefer a carniverous diet when available.</p>
    <h3 id="1-3-founding">1.3 Founding</h3>
    <p>Settled in the last years of M37, the initial purpose of Calor was to support the nearby world of Sinophia and the expeditions of the so-called "Age of Plunder". Vast swathes of flat terrain and ample availability of unrefined vellum were identified by long-range auspex, and a colony ship was swiftly dispatched by the Departmento Colonia; the decision to classify Calor as an Archive World was made before the first colony ship landed. Although records from the time are incomplete (for example: the initial landing was likely located in what is now Karresa Stack, however the exact co-ordinates are unknown), multiple sources confirm an error in resource allocation to the colonisation ship; the vast majority of bulk had been assigned to documents and records, with a sub-standard reservation for foodstuffs. This was not discovered until stores were opened upon landing.</p>
    <p>En-route to Calor, Quartermaster Olga Nekra (see section <em>4.1.1 Olga Nekra</em>) instigated a shipboard rationing system considered by many at the time to be needlessly brutal. Upon discovery of the administrative error, this extra food proved to be the only thing preventing starvation of the entire colony. Through careful management of starter seed and colony waste products, along with Nekra's practical and equitable implementation of the nacent Calor Lottery (further explored in section <em>2.4 The Feast of St Nekra</em>), the attrition rate of the first batch of colonists was reduced to only 28%, far better than the Administratum's most optimistic estimates. During this time, ad-hoc nutritional studies were carried out by the citizenry and a significant proportion of the local plant and animal life (around 1 in 10 species) were found to be non-lethal for human consumption.</p>
    <p>The excessive number of documents and records stored on the first colony ship meant Calor could gain a head start in processing, leading to a far swifter initial growth rate of the colony than statistically-similar Archive Worlds.</p>
    <h3 id="1-4-early-history">1.4 Early History</h3>
    <p>Bouyed by auspicious beginnings, Calor flourished. Quartermaster Nekra, now entrenched as a popular ruler, claimed for herself the rank of "Quartermaster-General", a title still in use today. Following her death and subsequent petitions for Imperial canonisation, a new Quartermaster-General took on the title. Further explanation of Calor's particular political system can be found in section <em>2.1: Governance</em>. The services Calor provided to Imperial assets in the Calyx Expanse continued to grow in importance and, by the time of the Angevin Crusade (322.M39), Calor was a vitally-important Archive World for the Calyx Expanse, predicted to be essential to the newly-created Calixis Sector, and already played an important role in the Administratum's duties across the wider Segmentum Obscurus. The increased management and requisition needs of the Crusade meant a large uptick in Calor's workload, leading to issues with prioritisation and timely completion of Calor's business-as-usual responsibilities. A swath of new construction ensued; the majority of Calor's current infrastructure dates from this time.</p>
    <p>In order to combat the glut of unprocessed documents, a large Departmento Gradio contingent led by Prefectus Secundus Sala Pasek (see section <em>4.1.2 Sala Pasek</em>) was dispatched from the Prol System, with the express mission to grade the urgency of documents and records in Calor's backlog. Pasek reported the mission as a great success, with reams of ranking folios created to track the urgency and location of incoming material. In the following years, the Departmento Gradio continued to grow in importance and size on Calor, resulting in Gradio Adepts making up the largest proportion of workers on Calor.</p>
    <h3 id="1-5-tithing">1.5 Tithing</h3>
    <p>Calor's original tithe grade was Exactis Particular - as a frontier world it was originally exempt from the usual tithe to the Munitorum. Prior to the Angevin Crusade, Calor was able to satisfy its entire tithe with processing of documents and records. However, since the Departmento Gradio's shift in focus towards urgency-ranked processing, the reduced output volume has resulted in the re-grading of the tithe to Exactis Prima, enforcement of their Astra Militarum tithe, and the subsequent founding of the Calor Regiments (see section <em>3.2.2 Astra Militarum</em>).</p>
    <h2 id="2-politics-and-culture">2 Politics and Culture</h2>
    <h3 id="2-1-governance">2.1 Governance</h3>
    <p>Following the death of Quartermaster Nekra, Calor continued the tradition of appointing the highest-ranked member of the local Administratum to the position of Planetary Governer, locally referred to as the Quartermaster-General. While this would be expected to result in increased political manouvering and skulduggery in the Administratum heirarchy, the influence of the Calor Lottery (section <em>2.4 The Feast of St Nekra</em>) has led to a balanced and controlled system of governance - there are no records of uprisings or revolutions on Calor, although the mortality rate of incumbent Planetary Governers is, of course, significantly higher than other similar worlds.</p>
    <p>The heirarchy of Calor is exceedingly flat, with few official ranks below the Planetary Governer. While this has not impacted the day-to-day operations of Calor's industries, it has led to exceedingly informal methods of address and a general dearth of formal behaviour, often resulting in fractious relationships with offworld dignataries and power structures.</p>
    <h3 id="2-2-religion">2.2 Religion</h3>
    <p>While the populace of Calor are amongst the most devoted of His subjects, Calor's Imperial Cult has a particular flavour. Following applications for the canonisation of Quartermaster-General Nekra and the foundation of The Holy Order of Our Inauspicious Lady, adherants have increasingly linked bad luck, hardship, and selflessness to piety. Numerous investigations assisted by offworld Ministorum assets have concluded that between Calor's particular interpretation of the Emperor's teachings and the peculiar system of governance present on Calor, the risk of rebellion or social unrest is low to nil. Care must be taken to monitor and, if needed, guide Calor's faith, lest they drift further from orthodox doctrine.</p>
    <h3 id="2-3-crime-and-punishment">2.3 Crime and Punishment</h3>
    <p>Due to the prevalent cultural and religious beliefs on Calor, crime rates are significantly lower than similarly-designated planets. The Adeptus Arbites have an almost nonexistant presence on Calor, with almost all legal enforcement and judicial responsibilities carried out by the Administratum's internal enforcers: the Literati. Corporal punishment is common, and major crimes are met with assignment to the Calor Catalogia for a specified amount of time. Capital punishment is abjured on Calor, with permanent work appointments in the Stacks sufficing for punishment of the most heinous crimes.</p>
    <h3 id="2-4-the-feast-of-st-nekra">2.4 The Feast of St Nekra</h3>
    <p>Calor's eccentric orbit results in a "Leap Day" every five years. While the local Ministorum's petitions for Olga Nekra's canonisation have never been approved, this holiday is unofficially referred to as "The Feast of St Nekra". All work is halted, and celebrations take place all over the world. For most citizens, this is the only time they will consume meat not sourced from the local psudeo-porcine populations.</p>
    <p>On this day, all citizens of Calor enter into the Calor Lottery, commemorating the hardships of the planet's founding. To honour Olga Nekra, more entries are allocated to individuals of higher rank, with the Quartermaster-General possessing the greatest chance of being selected, but in all other ways the lottery has remained essentially unchanged since its conception. The selection process is carried out in public view, with records checked and re-checked to ensure complete randomness of the results. Upon selection, the chosen citizens are purified in sacred baths, annointed with holy oils, then cooked and eaten.</p>
    <h2 id="3-groups-of-interest">3 Groups of Interest</h2>
    <h3 id="3-1-administratum-departmenta">3.1 Administratum Departmenta</h3>
    <h4 id="3-1-1-departmento-gradio">3.1.1 Departmento Gradio</h4>
    <p>The Departmento with the greatest representation on Calor today, the Gradio is responsible for the vast majority of Calor's labour. Following the guidelines and systems instigated by Sala Pasek, each document which arrives on Calor is recorded, analysed, summarised, and prioritised before being archived and awaiting processing. All findings are notated in ranking folios, which are classified and stored in separate archives. In addition, the Departmento Gradio is responsible for determining the priority of any documents recovered by the Calor Catalogia.</p>
    <h4 id="3-1-2-departmento-processium">3.1.2 Departmento Processium</h4>
    <p>The second-largest Departmento on Calor, the Processium carries out processing and resolution of paperwork. Due to the efforts of the Gradio, the most urgent documents are handled with the greatest priority, something which cannot be said for many Archive Worlds. However, the lack of manpower relative to the Gradio means the Processium on Calor simply has no capacity to process anything apart from the most urgent documents. This leads to the popular saying: "If you need something done now, send it to Calor. If you need something done tomorrow, send it anywhere else".</p>
    <h4 id="3-1-3-calor-catalogia">3.1.3 Calor Catalogia</h4>
    <p>Technically a Departmento Adjunctus, the Calor Catalogia - locally referred to as "Cats" - are responsible for recovering and cataloguing records which have been lost or misplaced. In practice, the Catalogia operate as scouts and explorers, roving into sectors of the Stacks which have been uninhabited for hundreds of years. Units generally operate independently, although previous Quartermasters-General have instigated large assults on the stacks, bringing together hundreds of units of Catalogia in massed expeditions. Invariably, the increased concentration of manpower has led to increased attention from local wildlife.</p>
    <p>Due to the danger of exploring the Stacks, a significant portion of the Catalogia's ranks - usually those assigned to the most risky ventures - are drawn from convicted criminals. While many die during service, those that survive can elect to continue their service voluntarily or return to civilian life, their debt to society paid. Due to the cultural significance of self-sacrifice and hardship, many elect to remain with the Catalogia. A Cat who has survived a handful of expeditions is greately respected by the citizens of Calor, regardless of their original crimes.</p>
    <h4 id="3-1-4-the-literati">3.1.4 The Literati</h4>
    <p>On Calor, the role of the Adeptus Arbites has been almost completely subsumed by the Literati. In addition to their usual role maintaining order, overseeing shifts, and ensuring workers keep to their assigned stations; the Calor Literati also enforce laws, judge guilt, and exact punishment. Planetary Defence duties also fall to the Literari, and as such they are trained in operation o fa wide range of Imperial armour. They also provide the majority of recruits to the Calor Regiments.</p>
    <h4 id="3-1-5-departmento-redactio">3.1.5 Departmento Redactio</h4>
    <p>Another Departmento Adjuntcus, the Redactio oversee the destruction or expurgation of any material found to be unorthodox or heretical. Known locally as "Reds", they wear distinctive coats and masks to protect themselves from smoke and ashes - unavoidable hazards of their jobs. Relationships are often fractious between the Redactio and other Departmentos, as especially zealous Quartermasters-General have decreed destruction of swathes of records based on nothing but paranoia.</p>
    <h3 id="3-2-other-groups">3.2 Other Groups</h3>
    <h4 id="3-2-1-adeptus-ministorum">3.2.1 Adeptus Ministorum</h4>
    <p>As discussed in section <em>2.2 Religion</em>, the Imperial Cult on Calor is outside strictly orthodox lines. The local Ministorum tacitly encourages the unofficial canonisation of Olga Nekra, and is responsible for the operation of the Calor Lottery. However, the Ministorum offworld have never cracked down on these practices, overwhelmed as they are with the widespread heresy in the wider Calixis Sector. This is bolstered by regular reports from the Ordos Hereticus and Malleus - the unorthodox practices of Calor hold no trace of heresy or corruption, and serve to maintain efficient and highly-prioritised processing of documents and records.</p>
    <p>Also present on Calor is the Order of Our Inauspicious Lady, a Lesser Order Militant of the Adepta Sororitas, subsidiary to the Order of Our Martyred Lady. Barely larger than a Mission, it is currently overseen by Canoness Jirardi Korres.</p>
    <h4 id="3-2-2-astra-militarum">3.2.2 Astra Militarum</h4>
    <p>Following Sala Pasek's priority-based reforms and the rise of the Departmento Gradio, Calor's original exemption from the Munitorum's tithe was removed and the first Calor regiment was founded. New regiments are traditionally raised the day after the Feast of St Nekra, with recruits having one last chance to celebrate and enter the Calor Lottery before joining the Astra Militarum. As participation in the Lottery is impossible when regiments are deployed, and all citizens of Calor must participate in the Lottery, recruits to the regiments are ceremonially exiled. Once the recruitment ships leave Calor, no-one aboard may ever return.</p>
    <p>The three main sources for Astra Militarum recruitment are the Literati, Departmento Redactio, and the Calor Catalogia. The Literari are the most versatile, serving interchangably as infantry or armoured corps. Their uniforms are tan, with light blue armour and weaponry. The Redactio are utilised as heavier infantry, their practice working in adverse conditions serving to increase their resilience in the field. They retain their traditional uniforms - heavy coats stained with dark ash and helmets containing rebreather masks. The Calor Catalogia function as shock troops, utilising their expertise in scouting and movement to flank and outmanouver opponents and in most cases absorbing a large number of casualties - with that said, the attrition rate for the Catalogia on Calor is essentially the same as those on deployment. "Cats", as they are affectionally called, wear piecemeal uniforms, most abjuring heavy clothing in favour of mobility.</p>
    <h2 id="4-persons-of-interest">4 Persons of Interest</h2>
    <h3 id="4-1-historical">4.1 Historical</h3>
    <h4 id="4-1-1-olga-nekra">4.1.1 Olga Nekra</h4>
    <p>Records of Quartermaster-General Olga Nekra's early life are scattered and incomplete. It is likely that these records exist somewhere on Calor, but the disorganised and uncatalogued nature of the majority of Calor's records - especially the oldest ones - mean this is currently impossible to verify. The most-favoured theory is that she was an Administratum Prefectus of middling rank, chosen by the Adeptus Terra for the colonisation mission. Some believe she was a Rogue Trader, chosen simply because she owned a ship to serve as transport for the first colonists. In any case, her current position in Calor's culture makes it difficult to separate fact from myth and legend.</p>
    <p>Although she is referred to as "Saint Nekra" by local citizens, petitions for Nekra's canonisation have yet to be approved. Regardless of official ratification, the local Ministorum have designated an official holiday to celebrate her (see section <em>2.4 The Feast of St Nekra</em>). While this may be unorthodox, there is no evidence of reprisals from out-system Ministorum representatives.</p>
    <p>As she was instrumental in ensuring the colony has enough supplies to gain a foothold on Calor (as previously described in section <em>1.3 Founding</em>), the groundswell of goodwill she generated allowed her to solidify her footing as Planetary Governer, offworld elements of the Administratum supporting her appointment in lieu of provoking popular revolt. Nekra ruled over Calor until her death in 055.M38, when she was chosen by the Calor Lottery. Her gracious and honourable acceptance of the selection entrenched her as a martyr for the young colony and led to her revered status in Calor's culture.</p>
    <h4 id="4-1-2-sala-pasek">4.1.2 Sala Pasek</h4>
    <p>Originally born as an Administratum Scribe in the Prol system, Pasek quickly climbed the ranks to Prefectus Secundus in the Departmento Gradio. During the Angevin Crusade, she was chosen to travel to Calor and lead the effort to determine the processing priority of each record present on Calor. Pasek and her Gradio retinue worked tirelessly, resulting in a brilliant system of classification for incoming documents. However, the number of records on Calor was so great that her team was not able to make headway in classifying records already present on Calor. In addition, the number of ranking folios this process created necessitated the creation of a folio classification and storage system, which she was not able to complete before her promotion to Quartermaster-General and subsequent selection by the Calor Lottery in the later years of the Angevin Crusade.</p>
    <h3 id="4-2-present">4.2 Present</h3>
    <h4 id="4-2-1-glene-samsu">4.2.1 Glene Samsu</h4>
    <p>Samsu has held the position of Quartermaster-General for the last twelve years, having survived the Calor Lottery two times. Her statistically-unlikely length of tenure has resulted in great strides forward, including the completion of Sala Pasek's long-abandoned folio classification and storage system. This burst of productivity has led to sections of Calor's Stacks not maintained in over a millenia being explored once more; records from Calor's distant past are recovered, restored, and processed every day.</p>
    <p>Although Calor still recieves more documents each year than it could possibly process, and the backlog of records remains unimaginably vast, Samsu has overseen more progress than Calor has seen in hundreds of years. Her lone failing is that she has not been selected by the Calor Lottery, leading some to believe she is less blessed (or less pious) than those who have held the office before her.</p>
    <h4 id="4-2-2-ryne-carreon">4.2.2 Ryne Carreon</h4>
    <p>As the current colonel of the Calor Sacrisans, Ryne Carreon has been exiled. She currently serves with the 61st Calor Regiment, the "Sacristans". Under her auspices, the Sacristans have won many honours for their home world, most of their engagements against the hated Xeno.</p>
